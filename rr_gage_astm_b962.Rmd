## Archimedes procedure for porous material density determination

Experimental procedure is as follow, for further detail refer to standard ASTM B962. 

1. Measure temperature of liquid to determine its ($\rho_{\text{water}}$) and find object theoretical full density ( $\rho_{\text{solid}}$ ) from datasheet
2. Measure mass of sample(s) in air(A)
3. Impregnate the sample(s) with oil
4. Measure mass of sample(s) saturated with oil in air (B)
5. Measure mass of sample(s) saturated with oil in water (F)


\begin{equation}
    \text{Green Density}, D_g = \frac{A \rho_{water}}{B-F}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{true density}, \pi_d = \frac{ D_g}{\rho_{\text{solid}}} * 100
\end{equation}

Parts using two powder type are made. Parts labeled bimodal should have a higher density then parts labelled unimodal.
