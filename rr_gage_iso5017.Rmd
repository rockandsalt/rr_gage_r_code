## Archimedes procedure for porous material density determination

Experimental procedure is as follow, for further detail refer to standard ISO 5017. 

1. Measure temperature of liquid to determine its ($\rho_{\text{liq}}$) and find object theoretical full density ( $\rho_{\text{solid}}$ ) from datasheet
2. Measure mass of sample(s) in air ($m_1$)
3. Impregnate sample(s) in fluid (Isopropanol) 
4. Measure mass of wet sample(s) suspended in fluid ($m_2$)
5. Remove sample from balance and measure mass of soaked piece ($m_3$)

\begin{equation}
    \text{bulk density}, \rho_b = \frac{m_1}{m_3-m_2}*\rho_{\text{liq}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \text{true density}, \pi_d = \frac{ \rho_b}{\rho_{\text{solid}}} * 100
\end{equation}

Parts using two powder type are made. Parts labeled bimodal should have a higher density then parts labelled unimodal.
