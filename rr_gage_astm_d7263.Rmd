## Archimedes procedure for porous material density determination

Experimental procedure is as follow, for further detail refer to standard ASTM D7263. 

1. Measure temperature of liquid to determine its ($\rho_{\text{water}}$). Find object theoretical full density ( $\rho_{\text{solid}}$ ) and wax density ($\rho_{wax}$) from datasheet
2. Measure mass of sample(s) ($M_t$)
3. Apply two coats of wax to the sample(s)
4. Measure mass of Coated sample(s) ($M_c$)
5. Measure mass of Coated Sample(s) submerged ($M_{sub}$)


\begin{equation}
    \text{density}, \rho_b = \frac{M_t}{\frac{(M_c - M_{sub})}{\rho_{water}} - \frac{(M_c - M_t)}{\rho_{wax}}}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    \text{true density}, \pi_d = \frac{ \rho_b}{\rho_{\text{solid}}} * 100
\end{equation}

Parts using two powder type are made. Parts labeled bimodal should have a higher density then parts labelled unimodal.
